 +# Example Binder with requirements.txt
 +
 +A Binder-compatibible repo with a `requirements.txt` file.
 +
 +The file should contain all Python dependencies that your notebooks depend on, and they will be installed using 
 +
 +```
 +pip install -r requirements.txt
 +```
 +
 +Note that many scientific Python libraries are included already because they are part of the [`base`](https://github.com/binder-project/binder/blob/master/images/base/Dockerfile) image for Binder.
 +
 +In this example we include the library `seaborn`, and our notebook  uses Seaborn to plot a figure.
